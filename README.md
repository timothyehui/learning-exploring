# learning-exploring
Hi, I'm learning about github as I'm taking the Google data analytics course.  I'm a Physical Therapist who's now working in healthtech.  So, I have new data analytic and visualization tasks, to mention a few.  In time, I'll be putting up some projects here for everyone to peruse.  Hope you enjoy!
